# Galaga to Dig Dug conversion

## Done

- Build rom batch for digdug added - untested
- Updated Arcade-Galaga.qsf to include the new digdug.vhd 
- Updated rom mapping to map digdug rom into each CPU...

## Todo

- Proms data from rom needs to be worked through - this will be data for palettes and things like that
- Work out what to do with 54xx.bin program and rom space - as it's clashing with the address space for digdugs graphics
- Finish annotating digdug.vhd
